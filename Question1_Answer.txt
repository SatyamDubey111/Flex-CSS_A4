Flexbox is designed to distribute space among items with in container, regardless of their dimensions or order.

Grid layout -> The CSS Grid layout, often referred to as just Grid, is a powerful two-dimensional layout system that allows you to create complex grid-base layouts with ease. Unlike Flexbox, which is primarily designed for one-dimensional layouts a single axis (either rows or columns),Grid enables you to control both rows and columns simultaneously.
